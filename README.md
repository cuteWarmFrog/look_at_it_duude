Here is an example of cute hardcoding which I found in Petrozavodsk state university in 2021 winter session.
That html file is a way their physics teacher to take exams automatically.
The hilarious part starts when you realise there is no backend, it works offline, so...  answers must be in the code!
But everything wasn't as easy as you think. Yep, answers were there but encrypted with 3000 line of dirty dull js. FUck!
What did we do?
We found the array of questions from what test should be generated ( more than 320) and delete everything but 20 ( size of test ).
Everybody was given same test. That's it
